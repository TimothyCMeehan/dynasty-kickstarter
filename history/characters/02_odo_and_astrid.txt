# Jorundr was born beneath a winter eclipse, his pale skin and silver eyes seen as a sign from the old gods.
# Though shunned by some in his youth, he forged his path through valor, saving a coastal village from slavers.
# He earned the respect of his peers through stoic bravery and discipline.
# His marriage to Yrsa was guided by prophecy—two touched by the north wind would bear a child destined for greatness.
